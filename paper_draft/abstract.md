Climate change is one of the largest existential threats humanity has ever faced.
Rapidly increasing global temperatures over the past century have resulted in 
volatile weather patterns and changing ecosystems. One way in which which we can better 
respond to climate change the most important methods for developing pollution mitigation 
strategies is to analyze the gases and particulates responsible for accelerating 
climate change. atmospheric gases such as Water Vapor (H2O) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) play

Climate change is one of the most complex challenges humanity has ever faced. It is a multi-dimensional problem 
that poses economic, social, scientific, political, and moral questions that must be addressed. One of the most
important ways of combating climate change is to research pollution mitigation strategies so that policy makers
and government planners are better equipped to  make informed decisions. We focused on the principle cause of global warming:
the polluting gases responsible for the rapid global climate shift. We developed a technique to characterize
cities by pollution levels of various gases and particulate matter using an undercomplete autoencoder model. By creating a
representation of pollution levels for numerous cities across the United States, we explored some of the more prominent 
features that characterize urban pollution. We compared two techniques for reducing the dimensionality of our 
input - Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Undercomplete Autoencoders. The two first two hidden dimensions represented a
large percentage of the explained variance in the model, so we clustered the cities in an effort to extract any useful features.
