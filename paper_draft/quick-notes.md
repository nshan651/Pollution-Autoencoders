# Carbon Monoxide
   - largest sources of CO in the outdoors are vehicles/machinery that burn fossil fuels

## CO standards
   - set by National Air Quality Standarsds (NAAQS) for CO for max carbon present in the air
   - Clean Air Act requires EPA to set national ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide as one of SIX criteria pollutants
      - Those six are: CO, O3 (ground-level), PM, Lead, SO2, and NO2

   - NAAQS Table of standards: https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table

## CO Standards Literature (used by EPA)
   - https://www.epa.gov/naaqs/carbon-monoxide-co-air-quality-standards
   - EPA has developed a characterization of CO standards that humans can reasonably be exposed to      - The primary/secondary eposure times that should not be exceeded more than once a year are 9ppm (9000 mcg/m3) over 8 hours and 35 ppm (35000 mcg/m3) over 1 hourZZ

## Health Effects of CO (NAAQS09)
   - Most critical ailment is hypoxia from CO
   - study suggests causal relationship between short-term CO exposure and Cardiovascular morbidity (US EPA, 2009)
   - Another study correlates ambient CO concentrations and increased emergency department visits for patients with heart disease 
   - Studies <it>"support a direct effect of short-term CO exposure on cardiovascular morbidity at ambient concentrations below the current NAAQS level.‚Äù</it>

### Epistemological Study on Cardiovascular Morbidity
   - Study done on LA and Denver, two cities with some of the highest CO levels in the country
