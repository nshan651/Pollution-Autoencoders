# Pollution-Autoencoders

## Overview
<p><i>Pollution Autoencoders</i> uses a deep autoencoder neural network to characterize cities in the United States based on time-series readings of various polluting gases and particulates. 

We compared the [Autoencoders](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/autoencoders.html) method with [Principle Component Analysis (PCA)](https://www.sartorius.com/en/knowledge/science-snippets/what-is-principal-component-analysis-pca-and-how-it-is-used-507186), an older technique for reducing the dimensionality of a data set.

The main advantage of Autoencoders have over PCA is in their capability of discovering non-linear relationships between polluting gases. Autoencoders are able to capture more of the explained variance because of this increased flexibility.

We measured the explained variance across 190 dimensions for each of the 8 polluting gases by performing a simple linear regression on the compressed data generated by both the PCA and Autoencoder methods. As a control, we also performed linear regression on the uncompressed data.</p>
