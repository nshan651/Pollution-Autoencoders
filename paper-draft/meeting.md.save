# Meeting 1
# Paper Creation Section 1

   - Divide up work
      - Intro/abstract, problem, methodology, biz case, results, related work/discussion
      - Someone should do the coding
   - Business case
   - Be specific about data cleaning/imputing (1-2 pages on methodology)
   - Add some nicely formatted graphs/features



#Meeting 07/20/21: 

## Methodology
- make co concentrationtable more readable, change font from black
- not much preprocessing was done
- dependent is part of the input
- "normalized the x values in the input data"
- reason why we picked scalar
- justify the "Why"
- "we segregated the x and y in input data then we normalized x"
- feature addition of daily averages of hourly data
- write down thought process in notes
- change boxes
- change data pipeline so that ae/pca in box 3, linreg on encoded/unencoded,
  results of all three
- Add more details to methodology
- feature engineering/processing
- why did we take the mean of every day?
- why didn't we need to impute values?
- check if greater than 10% zeroes present in the values
- muted colors like blue/green scale in CO

## TODO:

âœ“ make co concentrationtable more readable, change font from black
- add more to preprocessing
- fix part about dependent var
- add to the reasoning in the methodology/abstracts. "Why?"
- write down thought process in notes
- Change pipeline graphic in box 3, linreg on encoded/encoded data
    - results of all three
