    abstract = {High-dimensional data poses a severe challenge for data mining. Feature selection
    is a frequently used technique in pre-processing high-dimensional data for successful
    data mining. Traditionally, feature selection is focused on removing irrelevant features.
    However, for high-dimensional data, removing redundant features is equally critical.
    In this paper, we provide a study of feature redundancy in high-dimensional data and
    propose a novel correlation-based approach to feature selection within the filter
    model. The extensive empirical study using real-world data shows that the proposed
    approach is efficient and effective in removing redundant and irrelevant features.},
